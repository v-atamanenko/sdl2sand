SDL2Sand
-----------------
The aim of this program is to simulate different particles (such as sand, water, oil or fire) interacting with each other.
Freedom is given to the player to experiment with the different materials in a sandbox environment.

Origins
-----------------
The SDL Sand game (The Falling SDL-Sand Game) is a C++ implementation of the original 'World of
Sand' (and later 'Hell of Sand') game implemented in JAVA. SDL Sand uses the SDL library for
screen output. Therefore the implementation can possibly run on every platform supported by SDL.

The aim is to create a faster implementation of the game and possibly extend its features.
